## Abstract :
<p align="justify"> In recent years social media has become one of the major forum for expressing human views and emotions. With the help of smart phones and high speed internet, anyone can express their views in Social media. However this can also lead to spread of hatred and violence in the society. Therefore it is necessary to build a method to find and support helpful social media content. In this paper we studied Natural Language Processing approach for detecting Hope speech in a given sentence. We developed a BERT model to help us classify whether the given sentence belongs to hope or non-hope class. Our model achieved 1st rank in Kannada language with a weighted average F1 score of 0.750, 2nd rank in Malayalam language a weighted average F1 score of 0.740  , 3rd rank in Tamil language a with weighted average F1 score of 0.390 and 6th rank in English language with a weighted average F1 score of 0.880. </p>
